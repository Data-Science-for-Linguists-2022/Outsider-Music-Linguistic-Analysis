    "### Prior to the Creation of this Script:\n",
    "I have scraped the list of musicians from Wikipedia using wiki_musicians.py.  I manually cleaned the text file to remove double quotations (\"\") and parentheticals like \"(performer),\" \"(musician),\" and \"(singer),\" since it was manageable with just 111 artists.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then retrieved lyrics from these artists from Genius.com using lyricsgenius_requests.ipynb, where 70+ artist-queries successfully returned JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I created and pickled the lyrics data frame (or rough_df.pkl, not uploaded in the repo) in the [load_json_to_df.ipynb](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Outsider-Music-Linguistic-Analysis/blob/main/scripts_%26_analysis/2_load_json_to_df.ipynb) script, where an additional 8 artists could not be successfully loaded, due to entirely null lyrical entries.  This pickled data frame remains in my local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps above were broken into multiple scripts to avoid re-running time-intensive queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Progress Report Info:\n",
    "This script represents the end of Progress Report 1 and the main body of Progress Report 2.  PR1 was split into multiple scripts/notebooks so that data collection steps wouldn't be re-run."

Who? Where? I wanna move through time With me on my mind I wanna be the driver I wanna say to my selves \"Move like you should, assemble yourselves And do right for this body, this mind This soul, this spirit, this being\" I wanna live right I wanna live so right I don’t wanna go wrong And I see myself goin wrong So I’ve got to stop I’ve got to summon my powers I’ve got to drop off all the dead and dying I got to cauterize my wounds I got to stem the tide of the bad I got to say \"Stop, turn around Go back to from where you came\" I wanna be right, you bad go back Go back to from where you came Bad bad, go back, bad bad, go back I wanna be right I wanna be right I wanna control my body my soul my mind my spirit I wanna be in charge I wanna say it’s like this I wanna say it’s like that I don’t wanna be told Don’t wanna be told \"You gotta be like that You gotta be like this\" Cause it don’t help none I know why I know where I know how I know when I wanna be I know what I wanna be I know how I wanna be I know when I wanna be I know where I wanna be I wanna be right in my own mind If I can’t be right I’m gonna be gone I don’t wanna be gone I just wanna be, me, here, now Give me another chance Give one more chance And let me do right Once and for all All time eternally I wanna be right eternally I don’t have to be alone I can be alone I don’t have to be alone But I can be alone But I don’t have to be alone It doesn’t matter Right is right It comes from outside, not from the outside I wanna be right from the inside out I want you to see I want them to see I want to be right for everyone to see I wanna be right For me, for you, for them, for the elements For space, for time Please give me another chance Don’t let it be gone Don’t it be the end of being right I saw myself right I let it go, give it back Give me another chance, give it back I let it go, give it back Give me another chance I wanna live right I wanna live right I wanna be in charge of my life My death, my eternity I wanna be right And I’ll do anything I gotta summon my powers I gotta be myself I gotta have my will I gotta be myself I gotta get my strength I gotta conquer these foes I gotta beat up on bad I gotta elevate the good It’s so easy to see Bad and good, I can see I can see what’s bad and good I can look I can tell I can judge I can point my finger And say \"That’s bad, that’s good\" And deep inside I know I can’t be wrong If I’m right, give me another chance I wanna be right I wanna be right I wanna be right Give me another chance Give me another chance Give me another chance Cause I looked at myself And I saw bad I looked at myself and I said \"Oh, is it too late?\" Is it too late? Oh, please don’t let it be too late Don’t let it be too late Help me reverse this trend Help me stem this tide Help me put my hand down and say \"Stop, turn around Go back to from where you came\" Let me take the good Let me put it in myself Let me digest the good Let me emanate the good Let me be in control Don’t let this sickness take me over Don’t let these things get me down Don’t let these things take effect Don’t let em change me And I don’t mind if I change But let it be good Let me change to the good Every time I change Every second I move Every time I turn around Kill the bad, kill em Kill the bad Kill the bad Generate the good in me Kill the bad things I got inside me Let them die They don’t deserve, let em die Just kill em It ain’t like killin’ no It’s annihilation, extermination Elimination elimination Eliminate the bad Cast the bad Eliminate the bad I want to be good I wanna be right There’s only one judge of that I know I wanna be right I gotta see myself right I got to see myself If I’m not right, why not? Cause I did bad Yeah, I did bad And I’ll tell you this Bad is different for everyone that is different And that’s everyone and everything So your bad’s not my bad But I got bad and you bad Unless I don’t know you like I know me But I know me, and I got bad, and I got wrong And I don’t like it And I want to eliminate it I want it gone before I’m gone I want bad to be gone before I’m gone I don’t want to be gone I want bad to be gone so I can be I don’t be right I wanna be right Give me another chance Give me another chance I won’t let you down, not this time Three strikes and you’re out And I had one And I hit a home run But I stopped after first base And hey, they They pushed me, they They pushed and pulled But they couldn’t pull me any farther than that Must of been fear I think it was fear Cause I had it made I had the whole home run But I missed it Second time up I hardly even swung I didn’t even try I quit trying I knew what I should be doin Every once in a while I’d touch my little toe in the water But I never did jump in I never did dive in to that water And that’s what I know I gotta do now Cause if I don’t do it now I’m gone Because wrong is at the point It’s at the point of smothering me Smoldering me, drowning me Putting me out And I need to burn my flame I need to ignite I need to spark I need to beam I need to shine my light Give me another chance to shine my light I don’t want to go down I don’t have to go down Not if I got some will And I got some power And I got some strength And I got some control And I’m the driver And I’m in charge I can do it I can do it Hey, I got to do it If I don’t do it, I’m done It’s either do or be done I’m not over yet I’m not over I’m never gonna be over I’m never gonna end I shall not end I’m not gonna be gone I’m gonna be forever Eternally I shall be And I’m not saying That I always was I’m saying I shall always be And I make this decision now I shall be I want to do right And there is no eye in this universe That can tell me What right is, because I know what right is And I know what wrong is By this time I know Give me another chance Give me another chance I surely need your help I surely need your help To conquer death To conquer evil To conquer bad I wanna be in charge I wanna control my destiny I wanna live up to my standards I know it can be done It came sharp and quick And you helped me And I conquered all Now it’s come slow and soft And I need your help For the last time Cause if it’s not this time I believe it’s never And I can’t face that I don’t have to face that I demand your assistance It only takes one word And that word is yes Give me your yes And I’ll give you mine I gave you mine I forgot it, and I’m sorry But you hit me hard'"
