    "I have scraped the list of musicians from Wikipedia using [0_wiki_musicians.py](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Outsider-Music-Linguistic-Analysis/blob/main/scripts_%26_analysis/0_wiki_musicians.py).  I manually cleaned the text file ([0_wiki_musicians.txt](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Outsider-Music-Linguistic-Analysis/blob/main/scripts_%26_analysis/0_wiki_musicians.txt)) to remove double quotations (\"\") and parentheticals like \"(performer),\" \"(musician),\" and \"(singer),\" since it was manageable with just 111 artists.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then retrieved lyrics from these artists from Genius.com using [1_lyricsgenius_requests.ipynb](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Outsider-Music-Linguistic-Analysis/blob/main/scripts_%26_analysis/1_lyricsgenius_requests.ipynb), where 70+ artist-queries successfully returned JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I created and pickled the lyrics data frame (or rough_df.pkl, not uploaded in the repo) in the [2_load_json_to_df.ipynb](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Outsider-Music-Linguistic-Analysis/blob/main/scripts_%26_analysis/2_load_json_to_df.ipynb) script, where an additional 8 artists could not be successfully loaded, due to entirely null lyrical entries.  This pickled data frame remains in my local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps above were broken into multiple scripts to avoid re-running time-intensive queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone interested in recreating the dataset should start with the `lyricsgenius` requests using the musician list.\n",
