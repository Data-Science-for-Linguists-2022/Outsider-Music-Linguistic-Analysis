    "### Prior to the Creation of this Script:\n",
    "I have scraped the list of musicians from Wikipedia using wiki_musicians.py.  I manually cleaned the text file to remove double quotations (\"\") and parentheticals like \"performer,\" \"musician,\" and \"singer,\" since it was manageable with just 111 artists.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then retrieved lyrics from these artists from Genius.com using lyricsgenius_requests.ipynb, where 70+ artist-queries successfully returned JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I created and pickled the lyrics data frame (or rough_df.pkl) in the load_json_to_df.ipynb script, where an additional 8 artists could not be successfully loaded, due to entirely null lyrical entries.  This pickled data frame remains in my local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps above were broken into so many scripts to avoid re-running time-intensive queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data Sharing Problem:\n",
    "Because the musician files and the pickled data frame are somewhat large and the data is fairly accessible (and fairly static in nature) through the Genius API, I have decided not to publish it but to maintain snippets of the data in presentation, as well as the Crispin Glover JSON included in `data_samples`, for reference to the JSON file structure."
