# Outsider-Music-Linguistic-Analysis
This is Emma McKibbin's term project.

## Project Summary:
***A Linguistic Look Inside Outsider Music***

This project aims to identify linguistic characteristics common among songs in the genre of "outsider music," made by inexperienced or self-taught artists (e.g. "Tiptoe Through the Tulips with Me" by Tiny Tim).  Are outsider lyrics as childlike, nonsensical, or repetitive as they're thought to be?  What themes or lyrical distributions might distinguish outsider music from "insider," or popular, music?
